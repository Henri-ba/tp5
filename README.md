# TP5

## Description

Cryptographic encription framework.

## How to contribute
From now on, the only way to contribute will be through pull request.
To first contribute, you need to fork the project on your own. 
I will only accept pull request created on the devlop branch.
Only **tested** code will be allowed in the project.
Only **non conflicting** pullrequest will be allowed to merge. 
Colaborators are a thing of the past cause they create too much conflicts in the core files.
So, I suggest you learn github the correct way and contributing using the pullrequest workflow.
You can also use issues freely. And feel free to ask questions.

## Ps
I am sorry if I am taking so much drastic measures to ensure that the project is good.
